Many professional esports players have adopted mice under 70g, according to tournament equipment lists and player interviews published by organizations like ESPN Esports and official team announcements.\n\nThe principle is straightforward—less mass requires less force to move, which can translate to quicker adjustments and potentially reduced wrist strain over time.\n\nHowever, lighter isn't always better for everyone. Some players prefer more heft for stability and control. That's why we've included comparison options above 60g for those who want the full context.\n\n---\n\n## Detailed Product Analysis\n\n### 🏆 1.
